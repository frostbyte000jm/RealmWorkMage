They acted like nothing happened. You don't notice something till it is gone. Imagine walking around a village full of people, but no children. Not a single one. It was eerie. It wasn't for a couple days trying to get some information till a mother came up to me and told me &quot;They were playing out in the fields&quot;. Her husband took her away. </span>

        <br/>I went to the fields to investigate. I tried to find tracks, toys, anything that would point me to the children. I remember most of the troop was out there with me, searching. I knocked over a scarecrow, and when I was sitting it back up trying to get it in place, I saw the eyes move. They looked right at me. They were human eyes. The kids were turned into scarecrows. <br/>
