        <span class="rwStyle17">Backstory</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Sani was born upon a Navajo reservation in New Mexico.  At his adolescence, he attended the annual “Rise of the Nations” event in Arizona.  He met with members of several tribes, imbibed Peyote, and ended up high as hell with members of the Mandan tribe.  The Mandans were one of the original peoples to use suspension as a form of enlightenment (along with neo-stone age Indians south of Tibet).  With the frame of mind that Sani was in, Suspension sounded great.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                Sani damn near died.  Between the Peyote and Suspension, he begun to hallucinate; although the hallucinations were actually and positively real!  There was no doubt in Sani’s mind.  Sani was approached by a coyote, which was laughing.  The laughter was contagious, and Sani found this hilarious!  At this point the coyote began to stand on his hind legs and dance, so Sani did as well.  This was all great fun.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                The next day, Sani awoke in a Teepee belonging to a Sioux Medicine Man.  The Sioux asked him if he saw Coyote, and Sani realized that he danced with the Navajo Trickster God “Coyote”.  Since that time Coyote has evolved and may arrive in Sani’s mind as a coyote, as a coyote man hybrid, or as “Coyote” the Trickster God (which looks a lot like T-Hawk from the old Street Fighter Games”.  Coyote always has “ADVICE” as opposed to advice, which tends to portent things in reality in very strange ways.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                Over the next several years, Sani grew into a speaker for the United Tribes, which really paid off in television ads paid for by state and federal agencies with the “Rise of the Nations” organization being paid a percentage of money from the ads.  Sani became well known after working closely with producers and tribes to bring about this commercial (</span>
        <span class="rwStyle27">
          <a href="https://youtu.be/j7OHG7tHrNM" class="rwStyle27">https://youtu.be/j7OHG7tHrNM</a>
        </span>
        <span class="rwStyle27">).</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                During this time, Sani’s relationship with Coyote developed.  Coyote is a devious trickster, and Sani is really not sure if Coyote is responsible for the scams he started running, or if these personality traits naturally developed.  Sani developed two strong personalities/aliases; Abbas Oman and Vihaan Reyansh.  Sani has used these two so frequently in scams and cons that he can slip into either character with a heartbeat.  Life magick also helps with the identity changes! (beard length, eye, and hair color, not to mention defining characteristics like moles and birthmarks that throw off most recognition).</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Abbas often wears a white thawb and keffiyeh and sports a long salt and pepper beard.  He often refers to his “exalted master”, which he claims is a rich sheik, but will never mention his name.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                Vihaan dresses as an Indian born in the mother country that moved to America at a young age.  He can play a more traditional role, or can be more Americanized.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                Sani tends to work towards the betterment of the people, and directly against anyone that tries to keep the people in the dark in regards to magick and the “Truth”.  The “Truth” that Sani so greatly believes in is the great wheel.  To quote Robert Jordan “</span>
        <span class="rwStyle20">The </span>
        <span class="rwStyle1">Wheel of Time</span>
        <span class="rwStyle20"> turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents ">
        <span class="rwStyle20">                If Sani and Coyote are correct, and the wheel moves faster, father can teach son, then when the father dies and is reborn, son can teach father.  This will bring about Ascension for all of The People.  Sani must determine people and things that slow and try to stop the wheel, and as Ethanatoi, give those people and things an opportunity for rebirth and redemption (Sani really opposes looking at this as outsiders do; it’s not about death).</span>

        <span class="rwStyle17">Collaborative Backstory (Sani, Vic)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle44">            </span>
        <span class="rwStyle27">I’m what people refer to as a fixer; face man; the guy that gets things moving.  Based on my reputation, I have recently found myself in the lap of luxury at the Snoqualmie Casino, just outside of Seattle.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                I was summoned by the Elder Council to “fix” a problem…But wait, let me back up a bit.  Most people think that the “Chief” or “Chieftains” run the tribe.  Today, Chiefs and such are voted into the position more often than not.  They are like elected government officials, and sometimes just as corrupt as government officials.  The true power of The People usually lies within the Council of Elders.  Most “Elders” are medicine men and women, what you would call Verbena but many are Dreamspeakers.  Unfortunately, the Elder Council of the Snoqualmie are Dreamspeakers.  I am used to Verbena and understand how they work.  They are in my comfort zone.  Dreamspeakers are something else entirely.  They think differently; it is all about ancestry and spirit.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                Ok, now back to where we are now… The Elder Council, particularly Elisha Moses, hired me to fix a problem.  It seems like their Chief, who holds legal power over the tribe, sold 45 acres of wilderness to Dumus Genetics out of Seattle.  This “wilderness” is actually tribal burial land, and Chief “Jerry” made a cool million to do it.  The check wasn’t written to the tribe, which wouldn’t have accepted no matter the price, but to “Jerry”.  Now Jerry bought a house in South Beach Miami, but when his plane landed, no one saw Jerry. I wonder where Jerry is buried.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">                For $75,000 (paid as casino winnings) I need to dispose of all the paperwork before the land deal closes.  For me this isn’t a problem.  The Snoqualmie have already repaid the money, but Dumus Genetics has not retracted the paperwork.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">It was easy to bribe the head accountant at Dumas Genetics to delete the transactions.  After all, it was a net zero as the million-dollar check was paid out and then the tribe paid it back.  No one in the company will see a red flag.  It was also fairly simple to convince the clerk at the King County Courthouse to have “my attorney’ review the original paperwork prior to closing.  A quick dinner with a beautiful woman was a small price to pay, and a bit of flirting as she refiled the paperwork distracted her enough to place fictitious documents back in the file.  Pretty standard work for me.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Later, that evening I walked back into the casino to hand over the paperwork to Elisha.  She handed the papers to her lawyer, another member of the Elder Council who quickly perused them and threw them into the fireplace.  Convinced that I was done here, I asked which table to collect my “winnings” at.  The lawyer pulled Elisha aside and they had a quick conversation and he left the room.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Elisha spat “You ignorant fool, do you really think that when I said to “delete the paper trail that I only meant fucking parchment?!  These days more electrons make deals than signatures!  Are you really that fucking stupid?”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">At that point she enlightened me on exactly how much technology has progressed since I was a child.  I didn’t move along with it, and at 51 years old, I found myself woefully unprepared for her tirade.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">“Dumus filed all of their paperwork electronically and provided the original documents.  You retrieved the originals, but the emails, uploads, conformations and electronic receipts need to disappear as well, fool!” Elisha stated with quiet vitriol.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">“Wait a minute”, I said “does this mean you aren’t paying me?”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">“PAYING YOU! YOU FUCKING IDIOT!  No, I’m not paying you, I am cursing you.  You have 5 days to take care of this.  If you fail, no one will be able to request your services.  ARE WE CLEAR?”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">“Crystal”, I grumbled. “If I succeed, do I get paid? “</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">“Of course, I am a woman of my word.  And I will remove the curse”.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">At this point, two damn big security guards hustled into the room and escorted me out to the cab lane.  One hailed a cab, and the other shoved me in and followed.  The big bastard informed the cabbie that we were headed to the “Hotel Andra” in Seattle.  I guess my luxurious casino trip was done!</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">The big security guard with me, whom I found out was named Lenny, drug me into the hotel and booked my room for 4 nights.  </span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Lenny said “You’re a nice guy, and I don’t want to see you die.  Find a way to fix this.”  Then Lenny left.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Normally, I would have been on the first bus back to Taos, NM., but I really wasn’t feeling like myself that night.  Typically, I would cover my tracks and be gone like the wind, but the most I could muster was a lame complaint that my room smelled “musty”, so the hotel moved me to a different room on another floor.  This was the worst distraction in my career, but all I could muster that night.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">That night, I had real trouble sleeping.  My higher consciousness, Coyote, was very obscure and pained that night.  Normally, he is kind of an asshole; always playing pranks and jokes, and generally a righteous know it all.  That night, he howled like a coyote in a bear trap.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">When morning came, I felt worse for wear.  Like my spirit was shriveling up.  I went down to breakfast and ordered an omelet and started looking over Greyhound bus schedules to get me back to Taos with a few out of the way stops.  When my omelet came, the first bite found me sinking my teeth into a fully formed chicken fetus.  This stuff simply does not happen to one of my magick caste.  Fate has always found a way to provide to me, not screw me!</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">I quickly gulped some coffee, but it was so hot; I coughed it out, and felt blisters rising on my tongue.  I hate creamed coffee, but I poured enough in to cool of the coffee so I could get the taste of chicken fetus out of my mouth.  The fist swallow was great, but the second lodged a hairball in my throat!  I coughed again, and I swear what I coughed out what looked like a Brillow Pad made of pubes!  This Elisha bitch really had cursed me.  I knew the Greyhound bus wouldn’t help now.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">I was truly fucked.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle37">Sitting at the bar, trying to think what to do, Sani turned his head and glanced at the info board on the wall at the end of the bar. Something glinted back at him. Moving to see what it was, he could make out an old business card sticking out from behind a flyer. In gold script the name Victor Black was written on the front and a number on the back. &quot;That's weird&quot; he thought to himself. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle37">     Against his better judgment Sani dialed the number. &quot;Hello, Vic Black speaking.&quot; Sani quickly chimed in &quot;Hello Mr. Black, this is Abbas Oman. I have been referred to you by a mutual friend&quot;. &quot;He'll never believe that&quot; thought Sani. Thinking of who could have referred him Vic, &quot;What seems to be the situation?&quot; Vic inquired. &quot;Not on the phone, lets meet face to face. How about the park, say in 30 minutes?&quot; Sani responded. &quot;Agreed&quot;. Not wanting to give up his anonymity, Sani went as Abbas Omen.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle37">    Thirty minutes later at the park, a man dressed in casual business attire w/ salt and pepper hair got out of a Mercedes and walked to where Sani was sitting on a park bench. The man sat down on the other end of the bench. &quot;Mr. Omen, how may I be of service today?&quot; &quot;Mr. Black, I presume&quot; Sani asked questioningly. &quot;Who referred you to me&quot;? &quot;Do you believe in Fate, Mr. Black? I actually found your business card stuck to a tack board in a bar&quot;. &quot;Fate is what we make it Mr. Omen&quot;. &quot;Well fate, as of lately, has not be very kind&quot;. &quot;So how can I help?&quot; &quot;I made a business deal to acquire some documents but didn't not realize that there are electronic copies as well. Not being very competent with computers, an age thing, I was wonder if you could help retrieve them&quot;? &quot;That's not really my forte but let me make a few calls&quot;. Vic steps away on the phone for a few minutes then returned back to the bench and sat.  &quot;Well, I made a call (</span>
        <span class="rwStyle25">to Xenori through The Firm</span>
        <span class="rwStyle37">) to see if there were any &quot;Data Retrieval Specials&quot; in the area but they all seem occupied&quot;. &quot;Well maybe there is another way to appease Elisha? She did say to delete the paper trail. Maybe we can destroy where they are holding the electronic documents?&quot; thought Sani. &quot;Mr. Black, are you willing to commit illegal but morally right actions?&quot; &quot;If the payment is right and it’s the morally right thing to do, then yes&quot; Vic confirmed. &quot;Give me day and the information you have on the situation and I will give you a call tomorrow&quot;.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle37">     The phone rings &quot;Hello&quot;? &quot;Mr. Omen, I reviewed what you gave me and pulled some very expensive string, but I was able to get access to Dumus Genetics' main server room. We will have to be quick, get in and get out. Tonight at 10:00pm sharp.&quot; Vic explained. &quot;Ok, Mr. Black, but how are we going to destroy the files and what is the prize of said help&quot;? &quot;Because its moral right, $75,000 should help recover some of the expenses; plus you will owe me a favor to be named at a later date&quot;.  Sani though for a second &quot;that's much more than I would like to owe but being cursed is putting a damper in my life&quot;. &quot;Done!&quot; exclaimed Sani.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle37">    They arrived precisely at 9:55pm. Quickly they move to a perimeter door and waited. Exactly at 10:00pm the door clicked and the LEDs on the key pad went out. &quot;Move quickly and follow me&quot; Vic explained. Quickly they made their way through the corridors, stop every so often to let a guard or two pass. They made it to the server room but the LED lights on the key pad where still on. Vic, with his back to Sani, pulled a piece of chalk out of his jacket and began drawing a circle around the pad with glyphs around it. A soft little chant and small arches of electricity came out of the pad. Vic wiped the chalk off discreetly. In they when with a soft click as they closed the door. Vic ask Sani to watch the door while he worked. As Vic walked around, he placed his Arcana sticks on the servers. When he was done he when over to a USB port and stuck a thumb drive in; hit a couple of keys and said &quot;Let’s go, the virus has been uploaded.&quot; Just as they started to leave the server room a guard called for them to &quot;Halt&quot; (just as Vic started chanting, the servers started to short circuit and shoot out electrical arched then burst into flames)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Thinking quickly, Sani (Abbas) placed a look of abject horror on his face.  “We have to run, it’s gonna blow!” as he reached out to the guard.  “QUICKLY! Before we all die!” Sani grabbed the guard and drug him along.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Once they were clear of the hall, Sani yells to the guard “run and get security!  Intruders uploaded a virus and left through the airshaft!  We will call the fire department!  Run, they are heading for the roof”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">With that Sani grabs Vic and turns to run while fervently praying that the guard doesn’t open fire.  As they leave the hall, Sani says to VIc “I honestly don’t believe that it worked!” as he pulled the fire alarm.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">“We’re not out yet” said Vic flatly.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">On the way down the steps they met two groups of guards and Sani yelled at both “Upstairs quickly, they are trapped on the roof.  Catch them before they get away with the data!”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Reaching the bottom floor, the pair quickly exited through the fire exit and into the ally.  Sani removed his robe and was wearing dark clothing underneath.  He then handed a red hoodie to Vic and said “Quick put this on and stumble like you are drunk.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Gagging while putting on the hoodie, Vic said “This thing smells like whiskey and puke!” and performed a passable drunken gait.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Sani’s overly loud response were the opening words to “The Drunken Scotsman” and an unstable shuffle.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle13">
        <span class="rwStyle27">Four blocks later, Sani stepped into another ally and leaned his back to the wall.  “The name is Sani Ahiga,” Pleased to meet you.  If you follow me, I will get you the funds that I owe you”.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents ">
        <span class="rwStyle27">  The next day, Sani met with Elisha Moses to collect his money and have the curse removed.  He left feeling much better and with $75,000 from “casino winnings” in his pocket.  The only downside was that much of this would be wired to a certain hacker, as opposed to filling the dent in his bank account paid to Victor Black</span>

      <p class="contents ">After graduation, joined Marine Corp. Six grueling years in the Corp. Achieving the rank of Sergeant. While on last night mission (before medical discharge), as Squad leader, lead small attack squad to ferret out a group of insurgents in a village where know hostiles stayed. As the squad near the center of the village gun fire erupted from all around. There had been misinformation, the insurgents laid an ambush. Calls for reinforcement over the radio were meet with denial. As the squad started taking dire casualties, anger and righteous fury seethed within. Suddenly flashes from his childhood flooded his mind eye, how he was taught about advance mathematics, metaphysics, Awakened history, about the Order of Hermes, and Magick; True Magick. Remember the tests, the instruction, everything. Everything just made sense now. With renewed vigor he reached out with his senses, his mind, and suddenly the dark seemed to fade from his eyes, and he could &quot;feel&quot; where the insurgents were. See them as if across a dimly lit room. Hell had come for them. He managed to decimate them. After said and done reinforcements arrived 30 mins later. During the adrenaline-fueled firefight, didn't realize he took several wounds to his torso and low extremities. It would be a career ending injury.</p>

As he entered the mansion, dead silence echoed through. Sheets covered the furniture, pictures, or anything that would accumulate dust. Strange, very strange. Where had his adopted father gone. In the coming days, a lawyer for his father's estate came and explained the great tragedy of Diossetep and how his father was a high-ranking magus in the Order and had been there at its destruction. The lawyer read the father's will and sign the estate over to the son. The lawyer also being a representative of the Order, extended an offering to initiation to apprentice under a master of House Flambeau, the house his father belonged to. </p>

They ended up in Western Europe. The meet with the Emissaries and for their first mission destroyed a major Technocracy strong hold. Over the next couple of months, they were on a whirlwind trip across Europe hit Technocracy assets along the way ending in Eastern Europe. During one of their missions a younger (19yr) “Orphan” mage was killed due to Vic’s love for his apprentice. Vic was supposed to be supporting the young mage, but his apprentice went headlong with careless ambitions into a firefight with “Men in Black”. Vic left the young mage to help her but in doing so caused the young Orphan to get captured. After the mission was over, we moved to the next target. Along the way Vic was informed by a colleague that the young Orphan was tortured then killed and mutilated as a warning (Turning point in Vic’s conviction to the cause). </p>

He tried to finder her, but she disappeared without a trace. Vic felt hopeless, with the violent death of the Orphan and the loss of his apprentice, he decided that the best way for him to fight for the cause was to support other in their fight. Over the next few years he spent his time setting up a network of brokers (mage base) to facilitate distributing funding to various mage organizations to help them fight the Technocracy (wither the groups do front assaults, hack the Technocracies networks, sabotage shipments or thief to name a few). Vic also set up a number of hedge fund around the world to provide sustained funding.</p>

        <span class="rwStyle27">    Bursting out of the second story window, glass shower to the ground, a well-built man jumped out of the window caring a fiery redheaded woman cradled in his arms. Just before he landed, he muttered something in a foreign tongue and as his feet were about the hit the ground a rush of air shot up cushioning the landing. The woman leapt to her feet, laughing in excitement. “Run Vic, they're right behind us!” she exclaimed. The two of them tore off down the street and turned down an alley; just then a man dressed in a black suit dove through the broken window, spinning a landed square on his feet. “Copy, two RDs heading north, in pursuit”. Looking back just as he turned the corner Vic saw the agent launch out the window, hit the ground, drew and fire his hand cannon barely missing Vic's head as chunks of brick went flying from impacting the corner of the building. “Shit, Agent Thomas looks pissed!”. “What do you expect when you blow up his place of employment. A slow clap?” spouted Evangeline.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">    Running down alleyways, turn left and right, trying to lose Agent Thomas but he was hot on their feet. Vic decided that he and Evangeline need to split up, to make sure one of them got away. “Evangeline, continue to the rally point, I will hold him off&quot;. “Vic?” she said hesitantly. “I got this, I have been counting his shoots. He should be out&quot;. With that Vic turn right into a courtyard playground between a couple of apartments building. Gun drawn, Vic crouched behind some playground equipment trying to get the best cover he could.  As the agent rounded the corner, thunderous flashes erupted at either ends of the small playground.  “Click, click”, “Jammed” Vic said with annoyance. “At least Agent Thomas is out too&quot; thought Vic. “Bravo Mr. Deviant” while slow clapping, as Vic just chuckled at Evangeline’s earlier comments, “You have caused quite the commotion, but don't worry it hasn’t put too much of a damper in our work&quot;. Quickly Vic drew a circle in snow, well what was left from last night’s storm, as he finished there was a popping sensation as the circle closed. “To cum Michahel archangelus preabueris virtute, ignis&quot;. Suddenly as if the earth had split open and hell came forth, gouts of flame arose from Vic’s spent rounds. (Flashback to the shootout. Vic wasn’t shooting at the agent but the equipment next to him and the ground in front of him). This caught Agent Thomas by surprise, but he was an experienced agent. Spinning around and draping he trench coat over himself, only stung a bit. “DAMN!”, Vic was spent. He had used to much of his magick in the attack on the Technocracy building. All that was let was try slug it out and hopeful get a good shot in and try to get away “but good luck on that” though Vic.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle43">He sighs dramatically and begins walking towards the agent closing the distance.  “You see. I’m more rested than you and confident I will win this fight, if only barely.  However, if my comrade over there joins, checkmate.”  Now only a handful of strides from the agent, he speaks softly, “so do you run or die here.”  </span>

        <span class="rwStyle31">Sasha leaps at the man, spinning at the last moment and hitting him with a backfist. Positioning all of his enemies in front of him, he looks back to the man called Vic giving him a questioning look.  Fight or flee? he thinks.</span>

        <span class="rwStyle27">Vic offers his hand to Sasha for a help up. “You take the agent and I will take the dogs!” Vic spat as he jerked into action. Sasha understood in a flash, with a quick jab to the agent’s chest. Agent Thomas grabbed Sasha’s arm with both of his hands just before it hit him, “Quit delaying the inevitable” Agent Thomas said calmly. Sasha smiled, flicked two fingers out and jabbed forward with his shoulder hitting Agent Thomas right in his shoulder joint. “Ahh” with grimmest on his face, searing pain shot down his arm as his arm fell to his side. With a quick twist of his wrist Sasha was free, stepped back kicking snow into the face of the agent followed up by a hard round house kick to the side of the agents head.  Distracted by the snow, Agent Thomas barely got his arm up to block the kick sending him stumbling sideways from the impact.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="contents  rwStyle28">
        <span class="rwStyle27">      Vic ran to the right side of the playground, as the dogs followed suit. Once he was far enough away to not interfere with Sasha, he stopped. The dogs surrounded Vic, get into attack position. Vic began chanting while drawing two trench knifes out of their sheaths from with his coat. As the first dog jumped at Vic, he sided stepped and throw a punch cracking the animal in the skull. As the dog fell to the ground Vic notice he had knock of some fur, revealing metallic plating and a dent. “Fuck!” he thought as he finished up the chant and the trench knifes began glowing a bright hot white. Suddenly the two robo-dogs lurched forward teeth bared trying to take a bite out Vic. Vic was too fast, spinning around slicing both robo-dogs across their faces throwing sparks as his blades cut through the metal with ease. Concentrating and reaching out with his sense he can see the radio frequency that’s control these robo-dogs. As they start to restart their attacks Vic dodges and block them while “cutting” the radio frequency umbilical cord to each dog with his prime infuse knifes; one by one they slump over and stop. “Hey Mr., if you're done, we may want to take this opportunity to exfil.”</span>

        <span class="rwStyle27">      Sasha holding his own against the one-armed agent, nether could land a solid blow on the other. “If you can offer some assistance?” Vic started to shuffle around the two combative, “When you get the signal run”. Vic stop shuffling behind Sasha, a pop sensation, knelt down and command aid from Archangel Gabriel in Latin; suddenly the area within the circle between the agent and Sasha became super-heated and the snow burst into steam. Sasha took that as his queue to turn and run. Both Vic and Sasha lost the agent with Sasha leading the way. Once they were safe Vic introduced himself “Victor Black, pleasure to meet you (handing Sasha a business card)”. “Got some fight skills; if you’re ever in the US and need work give me a call, I know a guy that could use you and he pays well too”. Sasha takes the card, stares at it for a second and puts it in his pocket. “That was fun, we need to do that again sometime”. With that Sasha gave Vic a forearm hand shake, turned and walked away whistling some old Russian tune.</span>

        <span class="rwStyle35">I’ve been keeping an eye on you, and you seem to be legit. I’ve improved your... “situation”. You can wire the money to me at the enclosed account number. And next time, just send me an email. I know you have it. -Xen</span>
