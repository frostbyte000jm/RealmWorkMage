      <p class="contents ">On a barren hilltop a few miles from <a href="Topic_106.xhtml">Red Larch</a>, you find four freshly dug shallow graves. The earth scraped out for the holes is piled nearby, although hastily gathered stones cover the graves. The faint smell of death hangs in the air, and several vultures circle overhead.</p>
      <p class="contents ">Excavating the graves, they find:</p>
      <p class="contents ">one male dwarf dressed in artisan robes (a smith from Mirabar)</p>
      <p class="contents ">one female human warrior dressed in a red surcoat with a black axe (the symbol of Mirabars army)</p>
      <p class="contents ">one male human warrior dressed in a black cloak with strange stony armor (an earth cultist)</p>
      <p class="contents ">one male human in a white robe with black feathers at the shoulders (an air cultist). </p>
      <p class="contents ">All died from arrow wounds or crushing blows, and the earth cultists who won the battle buried the fallen on both sides because they believe everything should ultimately be consumed by the earth.</p>
