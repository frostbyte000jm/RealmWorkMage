A short way outside the town that was his destination he noticed something unusual, goblin tracks. They crossed the muddy dirt road and passed into the woods to his right. Not willing to leave a potential threat alive this close to a peaceful town, he proceeded to followed them. Before reaching the end of the trail he was startled to hear shouts and the sounds of battle ahead. He rushed forward into a small camp and was greeted by the sight of two travelers being set upon by goblins. He joined the battle and together they quickly dispatched the offensive creatures.</span>
