He would travel from place to place to help out the poor, the sick, and the helpless. He didn't have much, but he was able to do things to make life a little more bearable for these people. Some people were able, with the little help from Langtee, to pull themselves out of the terrible place they were in. They would go to serve Langtee, but Langtee would refuse their service. He would instead say, 'there are others like you that need help. Find them, help them, and take nothing for it. When you have done this </span>
