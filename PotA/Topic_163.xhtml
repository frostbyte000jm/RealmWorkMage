There were always men coming to Princess Francesca’s village that thought they claimed more right to the leadership then she did. The men never expected to be undermined by a handmaiden. So Ginny would get her hands dirty by spying for info, stealing items that would cause problems, tricking the thugs into thinking one was working against the group, leading them into illegal situations, and more. Ginny was also the one who brought Jax and the princess together. </span>

Ginny, never seen the princess really interested in a man before. She knew she liked men, but no one ever caught her eye. Princess Francesca asked Ginny to find out everything she could on Jax. So she went to work. She made one little mistake when he caught her and brought her back to the princess. </span>

This was the start of their beautiful friendship. Within a year Jax and Francesca got married, Ginny was still the hand maiden, but would sometimes, covertly, assist Jax on missions. The princesses knew Ginny wanted more. She was made for adventure, but for some reason Ginny would never leave her side. </span>

More like a local force of officers that broke up bar fights or the occasional bad guy. No one was prepared for an invasion. Especially one on this scale. Jax goal was to get to his wife and he fought through the raider’s men and monsters to do so. Ginny was off sleeping in a tree when they came in. She was quick to arms and fought as many as she could. She eventually thought about Francesca and made her way to the keep. </span>

When the fighting broke out, he went to action. Tom ordered to have the Keep locked down to prevent anyone from getting in. Unfortunately, the forces were too strong. He ran to Francesca to try and protect her, but it was too late as he saw a ball of fire surrounding Francesca. The spell came from a red skinned man standing about 6’2 with thin black hair and some kind of goggles over his eyes. He looks at Tom and smiles. “I hope she wasn’t that important to you.” The flame magician got into her room by blowing a hole in the side of the keep. This was planned, the fire mage knew exactly where to go. </span>
